# bayesh
Bash command prediction using fzf. Based on your bash history, bayesh gives you statistical preditions for the next command you are going to type. That way, most of the time, you can let bayesh type your command for you.

This project is still in a very experimental state, but I use it everyday myself with joy. Let me know if you want to contribute üòÅ.

## Installation
I have tested the following on Fedora and Ubuntu
1. Ensure the dependencies are installed ([fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [python3](https://www.python.org/))
2. clone this repository
3. run `bash install.bash` from the root of this repository.
4. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc`
```bash
source "<bayesh root dir>/shell/bayesh.bash"
bind -x '"\C-e":"bayesh_infer_cmd"'
```
Now you should be able to generate bash predictions by pressing `Ctrl+e` in your bash terminal. It will not be too good at first, but after some time it will have collected enough data to (hopefully) generate great predictions.

### Some inspirations for this project
- [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/)'s excellent [blogpost](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) on how to build a spelling corrector.
- The exceptional [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and how to integrate it with bash's own [tab-completion](https://github.com/lincheney/fzf-tab-completion) framework

### Why "bayesh"? üëÄ
**Bayes**ian statistics on your **bash** history ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Currently this repo doesn't actually do any bayesian statistics, but it does compute conditional probabilities ü§ì.
